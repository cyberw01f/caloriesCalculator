### Availability:
For now you can build apks using the code, I will try to get the app onto Google Play Store and F-Droid repo in the near future.

### Feature planned for future release:
* UI overhaul to a more material design
* Add 'One rep max' calculator
* Add Macro split and diet suggestions
* Add Weight convertor
* Add history line graphs

### Android Permissions:
* As os now the app does not require any permissions to run but this might change in future.

### Why this app exists ?
I wanted to create a completely free and open source alternative to the applications present in the Google app store.
